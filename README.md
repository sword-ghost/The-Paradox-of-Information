"calling things by their true names is the beginning of wisdom" - Lao Tzu

consequences of the mechanisms of knowing;

-knowledge is the linguistic encapsulation of information within the boundaries of a definition

-infinite unique encapsulations are possible but all can be said to = [aspect of the universe] or a *thing*.

-Defining or naming a thing is the linguistic encapsulation and representation of symmetries found within patterns abstracted from observing [aspect of the universe] or some thing. These abstractions, approximations and correlations are not a true representation of the thing observed as information is necessarily lost/distorted/biased by the very process of abstraction and association involved in producing a [representative linguistic encapsulation] or *thing* 

-The name given to a thing implies and contains the qualities and properties determining by degrees it's relevance and relationship to all the other things that have been named üï∏Ô∏è

-The aspect of the universe observed however consists of individual and irreducible phenomena playing out over time; every single particle, position and interaction of the universe is entirely unique at any given moment = The universe is the only thing capable of a true representation of [universe]

Therefore

-The universe = One single, indivisible, irreducible totality with nothing inside or outside of it.

-It is the only thing that can truly be said to exist.

-Anything other than it exists as a product of the linguistic functionalities and mechanisms creating the frameworks, models and schemata necessary for the human linguistic/numeric, conceptual/metaphorical cybernetic UI we have with empirical existence allowing us to meaningfully navigate empirical reality, up to and including the *thing* named "I".

The age old philosophical adage "know thyself" is a fools errand for the very mechanisms with which we know things disallow the possibility of it.
