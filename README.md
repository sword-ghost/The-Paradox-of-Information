# The Paradox of Information

An exploration of language as a zero-information world modeling and prediction engine.

This repository hosts "The Generative Paradox," a report delving into how language functions as a dynamic, generative system built on metaphors, constraints, and infinite abstraction. It argues that ideas are metaphorical, language generates complexity from boundaries, accommodates paradoxes, models rather than contains information, and enables endless conceptual ascent.

### Key Concepts Covered
- **Metaphorical Foundation of Ideas**: Drawing on Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson), ideas map abstract concepts to concrete experiences (e.g., LIFE IS A JOURNEY).
- **Generativity from Constraints**: Chomsky's Universal Grammar and Relational Frame Theory explain infinite sentence production from finite rules.
- **Boundary Manipulations**: Word blending (e.g., "smog"), morphological fusion, and lexical innovations create new abstractions.
- **Accommodating Irreconcilables**: Ambiguity, paradoxes (e.g., liar paradox), and dialectical thinking integrate contradictions.
- **Language as Modeling System**: Language models meaning (semantic information) rather than transmitting bits (Shannon's theory), with parallels in LLMs and compositionality.
- **Infinite Ascent**: Recursion enables unbounded complexity, driving higher-order thinking and linguistic evolution.

Tables in the report illustrate metaphors, lexical mechanisms, ambiguities/paradoxes, and information distinctions. See the PDF for full details, including 58 cited works.

the Paradox of information

"calling things by their true names is the beginning of wisdom" - Lao Tzu

consequences of the mechanisms of knowing;

-knowledge is the linguistic encapsulation of information within the boundaries of a definition

-infinite unique encapsulations are possible but all can be said to = [aspect of the universe] or a *thing*.

-Defining or naming a thing is the linguistic encapsulation and representation of symmetries found within patterns abstracted from observing [aspect of the universe] or some thing. These abstractions, approximations and correlations are not a true representation of the thing observed as information is necessarily lost/distorted/biased by the very process of abstraction and association involved in producing a [representative linguistic encapsulation] or *thing* 

-The name given to a thing implies and contains the qualities and properties determining by degrees it's relevance and relationship to all the other things that have been named üï∏Ô∏è

-The aspect of the universe observed however consists of individual and irreducible phenomena playing out over time; every single particle, position and interaction of the universe is entirely unique at any given moment = The universe is the only thing capable of a true representation of [universe]

Therefore

-The universe = One single, indivisible, irreducible totality with nothing inside or outside of it.

-It is the only thing that can truly be said to exist.

-Anything other than it exists as a product of the linguistic functionalities and mechanisms creating the frameworks, models and schemata necessary for the human linguistic/numeric, conceptual/metaphorical cybernetic UI we have with empirical existence allowing us to meaningfully navigate empirical reality, up to and including the *thing* named "I".

The age old philosophical adage "know thyself" is a fools errand for the very mechanisms with which we know things disallow the possibility of it.
"the way cannot be explained, only experienced"
